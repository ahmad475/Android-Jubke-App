# Android-Jumble-App

INTRODUCTION:
In this lab I created an app which unscrambles words from a dictionary and then it displays them and all the possibilities for the word. The jumble app does so by creating a list array in the model and adding all of the words from the dictionary into that list array. Then we created a for loop in the unScramblings() method that went through the list array which we created and it compared the element in the list array to the input value to see i they had the same characters and if  they did have the same characters we added the list element to mylist which was created in the class.
RESULTS:
The results of our work was our new found ability to enter in any scrambled word and when it is computed the app returns possible word arrangements and also if there is more then one word that fits the description it. The possible word arrangement are displayed in order on a table which appears very well organized. The app also computes the information and adds all of the dictionary words to the newly created list then it does what is necessary to obtain any word containing the same characters.
DISCUSSION:
In this lab we learned a lot about arrays and how to add elements to arrays and also look through those elements using a for loop and finding the perfect function. Also this lab taught me how to organize table within android.
